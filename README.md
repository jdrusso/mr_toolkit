Tools for reweighting Markov models.

### Todo

- [] Remove `deeptime` dependency for kmeans -- replace with `sklearn`
- [] Remove `msm_we` dependency for connected sets -- really heavy
- [] Replace `pyemma` dependencies with `deeptime` (probably want to write some tests first)
- [] Sample NESS splicing + estimation notebook
- [] Sample reweighting notebook
- [] Sample Sigopt hyperparameter optimization notebook
